			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>Our story began when Aaron and Marty Cline fell in love, got married and had two wild and crazy boys. Our love for speed began at an early age. We would race anything we had from bicyles to scooters to dirt bikes. We enjoy racing through the mountains of southern West Virgina every chance we get. As we got older our toys got bigger as well. Come on down to the track with us and have a great time.</p>

			<h2>Bradley</h2>
			<p>Bradley has been going fast before he could even walk. Rumor has it, he put a turbo on his baby stroller. He has always enjoyed working on cars, trucks, motorcyles, or pretty much anything with motor since he could turn a wrench. He works as a coal miner when he is not building his next racecar. Remember "Do it for Dale"</p>
